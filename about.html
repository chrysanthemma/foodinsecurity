            <div class="about"><h2>About This Project</h2><br><br><p>Our goal is to empower UCLA students by giving them a chance to share about their experiences with food insecurity on campus, and whether or not they feel their needs are properly addressed by UCLA. Although there are resources listed by UCLA, there might be issues underlooked that prevent students from adequately getting what they need. Specifically, our map would like to empower students without a meal plan, which are those who live off-campus in apartments or commute to school.

            <div class="about"><h2>About Food Insecurity</h2><br><br><p>Although it might not be widely known, food insecurity is a prevalent issue on today’s college campuses, where “30% of college students in the United States experience [food security] at some point.”1 Unfortunately, food insecurity creates an inequitable college environment, particularly impacting minorities such as Black and Latino students.2 According to a study by the National Library of Medicine, students “experiencing food insecurity were also more likely to receive financial aid, work as a full-time student, and have worse grades in comparison to their peers who were food-secure.” As UCLA is no exception to this, there are multiple campus resources for students available. However, it seems that there are still issues with these resources not being highly advertised, as detailed in the Daily Bruin article “Op-ed: UCLA should address and combat student food insecurity” published in January of this year (2023).
